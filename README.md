# GRPC Gen

gRPCGen is a simple program for generating test from gRPC code generated by protobufs. 
gRPCGen will create code for both connecting to a gRPC service, and code for testing its various methods.

## Installation
gRPCGen expects goimports. Install both using 
```
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
go install github.com/yummydev/grpcgen
```

## Usage
1. Create a new package where all test code will reside
2. Modify the template below with your code.

```go
package sds

import (
	"github.com/pizzahutdigital/protobufs/store"
)

//go:generate grpcgen run --package . --target Client
var Client storedata.StoreDataClient
```
where the target ("Client" in this case), is the interface type to generate code for.
3. cd to the directory and run go:generate (replace --package . with the import path to run go:generate from anywhere)

## CLI Usage
Usage:
  grpcgen [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  run         Run Test Generation

Flags:
  -h, --help             help for grpcgen
      --package string   path (import path or relative) to the package
      --target string    name of the global variable that should serve as the client for test

Use "grpcgen [command] --help" for more information about a command.
